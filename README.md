# Association Rule Mining â€“ Mini Assignment

**Name:** Rosamistica  
**Course:** DSA 2040A  
**Semester:** Summer 2025  

## Description

This notebook simulates 10 transactions and applies the Apriori algorithm using `mlxtend` to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules. A rule is then interpreted in real-world context.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `mlxtend`

## How to Run

1. Open `association_mining.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to simulate data, run Apriori, and view rules.

## Sample Rule

- **Rule:** If Milk, then Juice
- **Confidence:** 0.75  
- **Interpretation:** When customers buy Milk, they also buy Juice 75% of the time.
